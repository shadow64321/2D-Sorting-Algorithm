# 2D-Sorting-Algorithm
This program creates cool looking graphics using a cool little sorting algorithm I accidently made. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it! ðŸ˜…

If your on linux I highly recommend running:
```
./Cool-Square-Patterns | lolcat
```

___

I'll try and patch the bugs later and maybe compile for windows


# Storytime
I was messing around with making a terminal based 2D cellular automata and was running a test when I noticed that it was outputting a perfectly sorted array.
It absolutely facinated my so I decided to post it here so others could enjoy it.
