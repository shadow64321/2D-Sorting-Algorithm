# 2D-Sorting-Algorithm
This program creates cool looking graphics using a cool little sorting algorithm I accidently made. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it! ðŸ˜…

## If your on linux I highly recommend running:
```
./Cool-Square-Patterns | lolcat
```

# Modifying the Output

If you wish to modify the array size things can get a little buggy but when it works it is worth it.

## How To
### Linux
1. in make.sh comment out the compiling opton for windows
2. in the cool-square-patterns.c file change the array size:
  - in this example we change the row to 50 to create the big squares seen in image gallery
    ```c
    //      row / column
    char GRID[10][50];
    ```

## I'll try and patch the bugs later


# Storytime
I was messing around with making a terminal based 2D cellular automata and was running a test when I noticed that it was outputting a perfectly (Kinda) sorted array.
It absolutely facinated my so I decided to post it here so others could enjoy it.
